# CS109a Final Project: *Music Recommender System*

## Overview: 
Provide an overview of the project. It is important that you include a general context for the project as well as an overall description of the project. Any introductory information that’s specific to the project should also be included.

## Motivation: 
Introduce the project motivation both as a whole as well as motivations for important defining aspects of your work. For example were there any visualization or UI primitives that informed your work?

## Description of Data and EDA: 
What data are you dealing with? What methods have you used to explore the data (incl. initial explorations, models, data cleansing and reconciliation, etc)? What insights did you gain? How did those methods influence your work?

## Literature Review/Related Work: 
This can include noting any key papers, texts, other software sources, talks or websites that you have used to develop your modeling approach and/or that informed your demo/site.

## Modeling Approach: 
What was your baseline model for comparison? What further models did you implement? Description of your implementations beyond the baseline model. Briefly summarize any changes in your project goals or implementation plans you have made along the way. These changes are a natural part of any project, even those that seem the most straightforward at the beginning. The story you tell about how you arrived at your results can powerfully illustrate your process.

## Results: 
Describe the results and emphasize the most important results. Did you have to reconsider some of the original assumptions?

## Conclusions and Summary: 
Review what was discussed in the Overview and Motivation sections (don’t repeat them word-for-word!). Discuss your contributions including the successes and areas for improvement.

## Future work: 
Discuss extensions to and new directions for your work. What do you think would be interesting to pursue next? Are there any ideas worth exploring that you didn’t get a chance to explore?
